# Hello, and welcome to my GitHub portfolio. 👋🏼

## My name is Reginald. I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science in May of 2023. 🎓
- I tend to make many side projects in my free time to boost my portfolio. As of writing this, you may see me working on my biggest project yet, an interactive discord bot that will allow Discord users to play a spin-off version of the hit game show, Family Feud, in **real time**. Check it out here:

- I have plans of making my own website to showcase my work and to delve deeper into web development using JavaScript, HTML, and the React framework, so stay tuned.

- I plan to boost my skillset so that I can work as a full stack developer, both as a career and as a hobby. I have desires to develop my own apps with interest in making them cross platform for both Android and iOS devices.
